# Global Suicide

Thanks for checking out our team's repo! Our team retrieved data from Kaggle.com to observe trends in global suicide rates from 1985-2016 across several variables including countries, continents, gender, and age groups. We cleaned the data, identified relationships of interest, created meaningful graphs to observe trends, conducted statistical calculations, and performed a thorough analysis of our findings. Please check out our 'suicide.ipynb' file to find our final data analysis and the steps we took to get there. You can find our project presentation in our 'Suicide Presentation.pptx' file.

<!--About the Project-->
## About the Project

Our team narrowed down our scope of years to 1990-2015. We chose to use our data to answer the following questions:
* What are the global trends in suicide?
* Does gender play a role in suicide?
* Which age group falls victim to suicide most frequently?
* What are the suicide trends in the US?

Overall, our team learned a great deal about the trends in global suicide rates across numerous variables from 1990 to 2015. However, some additional topics we would've liked to explore given more time are:
* T-Test - why is there a significant difference in the number of suicides between males and females in the USA?
* Human Development Index - there were several null values in the original source data; though this is a key metric when evaluating suicide.
* The relationship between GDP and suicide rates.
* The dataset gave us the "who" and "where." It would be interesting to explore more data that would help us to understand more of the ... "why?"

## Project Instructions

### Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows.

Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)

Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process

Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis

Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)

Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation

Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.


### Presentation Requirements

The presentation requirements for Project 1 are as follows.
Your presentation must:

Be at least 8-10 min. long

Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.

Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them

Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions

Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

Describe the analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

Summarize your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data)

Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean".

Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.
